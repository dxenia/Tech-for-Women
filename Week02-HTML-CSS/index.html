                <p>Whenever somebody asks what my favourite animal is,
                    I always say it's the butterfly. One would argue that there is a difference between an insect
                    and an animal. To me, they are the same exact thing. Butterflies are amazing creatures. Throughout their 
                    short life, they experience a lot of change - from larva, to pupa, and finally butterfly. 
                    They are also graceful and elegant, symbols of rebirth, hope and courage.

            <h2>The Butterfly Effect</h2>
            <p class="butterfly-effect">The notion that a small accidental event can cause large, unexpected consequences. 
                This is part of chaos theory, and it was originally studied by Edward Norton Lorenz,
                an American mathematician and meteorologist during the 1900s. 
                This idea supports the belief that everything in the world is deeply interconnected.
                Just like that, a butterfly moving its wings can cause a tornado somewhere else, far away
                on our planet.

            <h2>A Butterfly's Purpose</h2>
            <p class="butterfly-purpose">In the nature's ecosystem, butterflies serve several
                important purposes. The most relevant one is their ability to pollinate, 
                while also travelling long distances to do so. We should thank butterflies for 
                our fruits and vegetables! Butterflies have also been proven to be useful for 
                medical research, in the discovery of new drugs. These tiny animals are however 
                very sensitive to climate change, deforestation and urbanization, which put them
                at a high risk of extinction worldwide.
